## Available Guides

### [PROMPTING-AI-ASSISTANTS.md](PROMPTING-AI-ASSISTANTS.md)
**Learn:** When and how to add explicit documentation reminders to AI prompts

**Topics:**
- When AI handles documentation automatically (CLAUDE.md instructions)
- When you should add explicit reminders (one-off tasks, bugs, experiments)
- Example prompts (Bad → Good → Excellent)
- Reminder templates

**Use when:** You're about to prompt an AI assistant and unsure about documentation expectations

## Purpose of This Directory

The `docs/learn/` directory contains **lessons learned** and **best practices** that help you:
- Work more effectively with AI assistants
- Understand the rationale behind documentation patterns
- Improve your prompting skills
- Learn from past successes and mistakes

**This is different from:**
- `guides/` - Step-by-step how-to documentation (task-focused)
- `reference/` - Quick lookup conceptual information (fact-focused)
- `learn/` - Educational resources and lessons (skill-focused)

## Adding New Learning Resources

As you work with the codebase and AI assistants, document lessons learned here:

**Good topics for learn/:**
- Effective prompting patterns
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Decision-making frameworks (when to use X vs Y)
- Mental models for understanding the codebase
- Workflow optimizations

**Format:**
- Use clear examples (Bad → Good → Excellent)
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Include templates and checklists
- Keep it practical and actionable
