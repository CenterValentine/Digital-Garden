## Super power

- Leucine is oxidized in skeletal muscle without going through the liver.
- Nitrogen donor
- Stimulates insulin secretion
  - Shuttles nutrients into muscle post-training

Leucine triggers mTOR (cell repair process). It is a signal to cells that there is abundance and that it can repair.

1. Leucine enters the muscle cell
2. Leucine binds sensing proteins to release inhibition on mTORC1.
3. Phosphorylates p70S6K, 4E-BP1

More protein is not better if leucine distribution is poor
Muscle becomes temporarily less responsive to leucine (~3–5 hrs)

Sestrin2: Intracellular leucine sensor
Muscle protein synthesis (MPS): Rate-limited by signaling, not raw amino acids
