# contractile proteins

Muscle contraction

Key contributors
• Leucine – signals synthesis; present within contractile proteins
• Isoleucine & Valine (BCAAs) – energy + structure
• Alanine – structural backbone
• Glycine – flexibility in protein chains
• Glutamate / Aspartate – charge interactions for contraction mechanics
• Lysine & Arginine – binding and cross-bridge stability
