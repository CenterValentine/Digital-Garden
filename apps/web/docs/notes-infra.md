<!-- How did I setup the database? -->

Preliminary formulation and documentation:
I documented my requirements for my website in a [database development](./database-development.md) document. I investigated database management infracture for my application using several targeted questions to ChatGPT and Google Gemini. I considered using a managed database service like [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). I decided to use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) because it is a mature ORM with a strong community and a lot of documentation.

I consulted ChatGPT and Google Gemini regarding data schemas for my application. 6. I used AI to get the database schema just right for my needs setting requirements such as long term data preservation, performance, and scalability. 7. I used the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM to generate the database schema. 8. I used the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) CLI to create the database. 9. I used the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) CLI to generate the migration files. 10. I used the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) CLI to apply the migration files to the database.
