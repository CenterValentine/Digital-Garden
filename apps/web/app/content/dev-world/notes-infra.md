<!-- How did I setup the database? -->

1. I documented my requirements for my website in a [database development](./database-development.md) document.
2. I consulted with two AI models on data scemas for my application.
3. I used AI to get the database schema just right.
4. I used the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM to generate the database schema.
5. I used the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) CLI to create the database.
6. I used the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) CLI to generate the migration files.
7. I used the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) CLI to apply the migration files to the database.
