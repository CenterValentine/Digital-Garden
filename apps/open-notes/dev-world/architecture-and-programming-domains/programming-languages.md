# Foundation (programming languages) and delivery layers: (infrastructure and devops) :

## Python

Readability. Python is designed readable and easy to understand. So gap between idea -> execution is small.

Assumption: Developer time is more expensive than CPU time.

Tradeoff: Execution speed for maintainability.

Team: Data science, startups using flask. Corporate internal tools using Django would ensure every project follows the same security standards.

### Delivery Layers:

- Flask:

- Django:
  Gives you admin panel, authentication, and a database manager on day one. Synchronous code.

- FastAPI:
  A modern/speed built on async the enforces Type safety (Type Hints). Asynchronous code (blocking libraries don't work inside async).
