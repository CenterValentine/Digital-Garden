Long term framework examples where the cost of a bug is higher than the cost of development.

| Framework            | Opinionation                                                              | Constraint                                                                           | Application                                                                                                                                                          |     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **NestJS**           | No imports. Dependency Injection via service injections into controllers. | Controller doesn't own the database so real/test database can be swapped.            | Dependency Inversion Principle (high-level policy does not depend on low-level details)                                                                              |     |
| **Angular**          | Boilerplate (HTML, CSS, TS, and Spec) for a feature.                      | Huge learning curve and up front tax. Its a big framework.                           | Features are complete. Any Angular dev can walk into any Angular project and know exactly where the Services, Components, and Pipes are. Renaming variables is safe. |     |
| **Flutter** **BLoC** |                                                                           | The UI never has direct access to the logic. Bugs are in the BLoC not in a function. | The UI requests changes by sending an Event to the BLoC. The BLoC processes it and emits a State.                                                                    |     |
|                      |                                                                           |                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                      |     |

Opinionated context:
If your lead dev leaves, the "Opinion" of the framework stays behind as a blueprint for the next person.
