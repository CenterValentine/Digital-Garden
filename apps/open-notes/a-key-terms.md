**meta-curation layer:** a **root directory** of high-quality, community-maintained lists where each list is focused on **domain, platform, language, or toolchain**. Think of it as a table of contents for a knowledge lists. They apply **human editorial judgment** rather than popularity.

**knowledge lists**: an _editorial index_

**Curation**: Hand-maintained lists age better than algorithmic feeds.

**Decision Fatigue**: Many decisions need to be made in any aspect of a developer framework.

**Opinionation (Context):**
If your lead dev leaves, the "Opinion" of the framework stays behind as a blueprint for the next person.

**Long term framework assumption:** Cost of a bug is higher than the cost of development.

**Fortress Architecture:** A system that is designed to be highly available and fault tolerant.
